# Social-Network-API

Hello, and welcome to my README! This is for my Week 18 Challenge, which was to create a Social Network API using NoSQL. 

[Please check out this video for a demonstration.]()


It was my job to ensure my Social Network API had the following features:

- Use the Mongoose package to connect to a MongoDB database
- Include User and Thought models 
- Include schemas for Reactions in the Thought model
- Format time stamps 
- When using Insomnia Core, user is able to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE in "Users", "Thoughts" and "Reactions"


I was to create this Social Media API, and meet all of the requirements listed above, by using:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/download/core)
- JavaScript - ES6

I completed this project as a way to work on my skills using MongoDB and Insomnia Core, as well as creating databases by model instead of seeding a JSON file with data.

## Installation

The user must clone all files from this repo. It is important that the location of the files is not changed. 

The user must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed on their computer. 

The user must open the terminal, both command line and powershell will work, then enter "npm install" to download all the required dependencies (express, mongoose, and moment).This will allow the user to run the application as intended. 

To run the application, user must enter "npm start" in the command line. This will start the MongoDB server. 

The localhost must then be opened on Insomnia Core. This will allow the user to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE data as they see fit. This backend will only be available to the user on their own computer. 

## Usage
Here are some user experience highlights from my page:

## Credits
These are some sources I used to help me along:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
- [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
- [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment)
- [Insomnia Core](https://insomnia.rest/download/core)
- [Mongoose - validate email syntax](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18022365/mongoose-validate-email-syntax)

  
## Learning
Here are the highlights of what I learned and issues I had while writing this code.

- I think I like working with MongoDB/mongoose more than MySQL or sqlite. The virtuals and schemas were cool and easy to use and offer a lot more options for easy customization.
- I used regex as an email validator in the User model. It was intersting to use something like that for a custom validator. 
- I will say, the autogenerated IDs made by MongoDB/mongoose are more annoying to use, as you have to copy and paste them. This made doing the PUT/POST/DELETE of friends, thoughts and reactions more time consuming to do.
